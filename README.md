# Stellarator-Database
Includes the functions required to upload DESC or VMEC results to the stellarator database. You can access the database [here](https://ye2698.mycpanel.princeton.edu/).

This is still a work in progress.

## Install using pip
If you are on Linux, WSL or MacOS, you should be able to install `stelladb` directly from PyPi.
```bash
pip install stelladb
```
You may have difficulty installing on Windows due to `simsopt` dependency. More detailed instructions will come for that. For now, you can use the repo on Windows with slight difference on building the environment.

## Install using GIT

### Clone GIT repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlasmaControl/Stellarator-Database.git
```
Once you get the files,
```bash
cd Stellarator-Database
```

### Building conda environment
```bash
conda create --name db 'python>=3.9, <=3.12'
conda activate db
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are on Windows, `simsopt` might need additional instructions. If you just want to upload DESC results, follow these steps for creating conda environment,
```bash
conda create --name db 'python>=3.9, <=3.12'
conda activate db
pip install desc-opt selenium
```
Then, you can upload to database inside the repo, or anywhere where you can access the module `stelladb`. You can either git clone the whole repository or you can just get the `stelladb` folder of the repo and copy it to where you want to call the functions from.

## Sample usage

For more detailed explanation, refer to the `tutorial.ipynb` notebook in the [repo](https://github.com/PlasmaControl/Stellarator-Database.git).

```python
from desc.examples import get
from stelladb import save_to_db_desc

eq = get("HELIOTRON")

# if you are using DESC, you can directly upload Equilibrium or 
# EquilibriumFamily objects. For EquilibriumFamily, only the last
# Equilibrium will be uploaded.
save_to_db_desc(eq, config_name="test-HELIOTRON", user="username")

# if you have an outfile, supply the name of it without extension
# For DESC example, we need to save it first to get the .h5 file
eq.save("test_output_HELIOTRON.h5")
save_to_db_desc("test_output_HELIOTRON", config_name="another-HELIOTRON", user="username")

# use copy parameter, if you want the local copy of the files that are uploaded
# default value is False
save_to_db_desc(eq, config_name="HELIOTRON-test-name", user="username", copy=True)
```

You can give `config_name` as you wish. However, if there is an existing configuration with same parameters in the database, you will get following error,
```
Configuration data already exists in the database with name: HELIOTRON.
```
Then, you should change your `config_name` to match that and try again.

## VMEC Utilities are not tested yet!
